Improve website accessibility

In this challenge, some accessibility issues are going on with the code. This project has been created to fix them and improve the overall accessibility of the site so it is up to standard.

 What was your motivation?
- This project had the aim of adding Semantic HTML elements for accessibility reasons and correcting HTML elements so that they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Image and icon elements needed accessible alt attributes for readability while also having descriptive titles.

- From this project, i learned that Semantic elements in HTML are HTML tags that carry meaning about the structure. How to structure HTML and elements to improve accessibility and most importantly how to use Google to answer questions about what I need to do and learn from forums like stack overflow.

- This project was also great for gaining confidence in reading HTML, Working with VS Code, Uploading files to GitHub and pushing said project which is great.
